# Overview

To expand my knowledge and capabilities in JavaScript, I learned how to program in TypeScript, - its superset - using this youtube [TypeScript Tutorial Series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gUgr39Q_yD6v-bSyMwKPUI) by **Net Ninja**.  The lesson folders refer to the lessons and associated files I completed as part of that tutorial series. **They are not the demonstration files, and should not be considered my work. They are only here for easy access.**

{Provide a description of the software that you wrote to demonstrate the TypeScript language.}

{Describe your purpose for writing this software.}

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

 - I used VS Code as my text editor for this project.
 - Node.js was used to install the TypeScript Compiler.
 - TypeScript requries a compiler to be run since browsers do not understand it, so that was used.
 - The [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension for VS code was used for testing webpages and scripts.

{Describe the programming language that you used and any libraries.}
