# Overview

To expand my knowledge and capabilities in JavaScript, I learned how to program in TypeScript, - its superset - using this youtube [TypeScript Tutorial Series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gUgr39Q_yD6v-bSyMwKPUI) by **Net Ninja**.

I have created a simple webpage that allows the user to create notes, display them on screen, and store them in local memory. When the person loads the page, any exsisting notes will be loaded from localStorage and displayed on the page.

My purpose in creating this website was to apply my typescript knowledge and make a simple note taking app.

# Development Environment
 - Typescript was my language of choice for this project. HTML and CSS were also used.
 - I used VS Code as my text editor for this project.
 - Node.js was used to install the TypeScript Compiler.
 - TypeScript requries a compiler to be run since browsers do not understand it, so that was used.
 - The [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension for VS code was used for testing webpages and scripts.

# Future Work

If I ever feel so inclined, in the future I may add in a pop-up window that asks are you sure when you delete one or all of your notes.
